        Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of "All Hallows' evening"), less commonly known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, is a <span class="span">celebration</span> observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the <span class="span">observance</span> of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the departed.
