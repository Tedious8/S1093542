            <b>About Me</b><br>
            Born to a lovely family. I'm the youngest child. I have a sister.
            Our parents always taught us to respect and be kind to others.
            They always supporting me when I'm not confident with myself. 
            Including my friends the people in my city is very nice and kind. 
            They wouldn't hesitate to help people initiatively.

            <br><br>

            My speciality is that I'm a person that don't like to give up.
            If something doesn't work today, I'll try tomorrow.
            I keep doing that until I finally can do it. 
            Although, I'm not really good with communication. Not because I'm not confident to talk,
            but I would rather stay silent and not saying anything if I think it isn't important. 
            It's the habit that I have to fix and change.


            <br><br>

            Currently my hobby is photograph. I usually take a time to capture
            a rare moment with only a old smartphone. Although sometimes it's miserable
            that I cannot capture the scenery with my camera, I'm still trying to get
            a picture with a lot of patience.
